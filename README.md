# Mini Tune Generator
Generates a short tune that follows all of the basic compositional rules
enforced by my music theory professor for my final project. 
Prints out a chord progression and a melody over top of it. 
Melody is printed as just numbers, which are interpreted as the interval 
from the tonic. I unfortunately chickened out and did not submit something
generated by this as my final project.

I've also included a few tunes it's spat out in the examples dir--I haven't spent all that
much time putting the output into MuseScore as it's kind of a pain, so if
I ever continue to work on this I'd rather it spit out an MP3 or play the 
audio directly, rather than just spitting it out with the current
formatting.

It does an A-B-A structure right now, which is pretty neat. The whole thing 
runs on randomness and probablity for choosing the next note / chord, but
errs on the side of more acceptable (so inverted 7th chords should be rare,
as are 3rds and canonically uglier progressions like ii->viio6->vi).


# Usage
First, clone this repo, ```cd tune-generator``` into it, ```sudo apt-get install fluidsynth```, and ```pip install mingus```.

Run with ```python3 gen.py``` and hear your short tune played out! Feel free to mess with the parameters.
